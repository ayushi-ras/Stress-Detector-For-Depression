# Stress-Detector-For-Depression

Voice stress analysis (VSA) is collectively a pseudoscientific technology that aims to infer deception from stress measured in the voice. The technology aims to differentiate between stressed and non-stressed outputs in response to stimuli (e.g., questions posed), with high stress seen as an indication of deception. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based psychological stress detection model using speech signals. With increasing demands for communication between humans and intelligent systems, automatic stress detection is becoming an interesting research topic. Stress can be reliably detected by measuring the level of specific hormones (e.g., cortisol), but this is not a convenient method for the detection of stress in human- machine interactions. The proposed algorithm first extracts Mel- filter bank coefficients using pre-processed speech data and then predicts the status of stress output using a binary decision criterion (i.e., stressed or unstressed) using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and dense fully connected layer networks
